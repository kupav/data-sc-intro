    "\n",
    "Determinism: if we know exact initial conditions of a system we can predict its future states. If there is a small error in the initial condition the prediction error is also small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a spaceship launch. Given its initial coordinates, its direction and its acceleration engineers are able to predict its trajectory. Since the initial conditions are known with errors and this is unavoidable an actual trajectory will deviate from the predicted one. But a small error in initial conditions result in a small deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty: future states of the system can not be predicted with a reasonable precision, no matter how exactly we know the initial condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weather is an example of uncertainty. No matter how hard we try to measure the initial conditions: air temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and so on. Actual weather conditions will rapidly deviate form the prediction anyway. \n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty also appears when people's decisions are somehow involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty often manifests itself as stochasticity: behavior of an observed system looks random, not obeyed to some laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible sources of uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inherent uncertainty.** Quantum mechanics describes the dynamics of subatomic particles as being probabilistic. Weather conditions and people's decisions are also examples of inherent stochasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incomplete observability.** Even deterministic systems can appear stochastic when one cannot observe all of the variables that drive their behavior. When one throws a stone its trajectory endpoint is predictable only if an initial velocity and its angle is registered and a wing is taken into account. It looks stochastic if one can not observe the whole set of the initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incomplete modeling.** When the deterministic description requires a huge amount of information one can purposefully discard some information. Although dicing playing cards and tossing a coin are deterministic processes and in principle can be predicted, one usually consider these processes as being stochastic because the prediction is extremely complicated.

    "\n",
    "A deterministic experiment: no matter how many times we repeat it the result is always the same provided that the initial conditions are kept unchanged. \n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic experiment: even if the initial conditions are unchanged the repeated experiments produce different results. Closer look at the results revels that they belongs to a certain set of possibilities. And it is this set of possibilities that remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example when we roll a die we know in advance that there are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. But the particular result is random and can not be predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is introduced to quantify the uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "A probability of an event $E$ is usually denoted as $P(E)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability is always a number between 0 and 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probability 0 means that an event will never occur, and 1 means that the event will surely occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $E$ denotes a certain event, $\\bar E$ denotes all others events except this one. The probability of an event not occurring, called the complement: $P(\\bar E)=1-P(E)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Sum of probabilities of all possibilities must be equal to 1. It means that we consider a full set of possibilities: one of them definitely occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes initial probabilities and the results are represented as percentages: a number in the range from 0 to 100%. Obviously this is done by multiplication of the probability by 100%. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Postulated probability\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to define probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assign probabilities to each experiment outcome according to our intuition on the basis of reasonable expectations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest and the most reliable case is when we are **equally uncertain** of all possible outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the case for example for a fair die: there are no reasons to think that some numbers on its edges \n",
    "are more preferable then others. ('Fair' here means that it is full symmetric, neither side is any different from the other.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![die-1.svg](fig/die-1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The same situation is with a fair coin: landing it with a head or a tail on the top are equally uncertain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let the number of all possible outcomes is $N$ ($N=6$ for a die and $N=2$ for a coin). Since all of them are equally uncertain we assign to each event a probability \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P=1/N\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular for a fair die $P=1/6$, for a fair coin $P=1/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such equally uncertain outcomes are called elementary events.\n",
    "\n",
    "When elementary events have been revealed we can consider more complicated situations that include their combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: what is the probability of a fair die landing with an even number on top? \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability in this case is computed as a number $n$ of \n",
    "the elementary events that fulfill the condition divided by the total number $N$ of the elementary events.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P=n/N\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example there are 3 even numbers on edges: 2, 4, and 6, and totally there are 6 elementary events. Thus\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P=3/6=1/2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This way to introduce the probabilities is also called **classical probability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If equally uncertain elementary events cannot be reveled the probabilities can be assigned according to an expert opinion.\n",
    "\n",
