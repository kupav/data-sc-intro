    "This part of statistics is called hypothesis testing.\n",

    "It includes the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Form a null hypothesis. This is the statement that the property we are interested for is absent, one characteristic is not influenced by another and so on. This hypothesis is usually denoted as $H_0$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Form an alternative hypothesis $H_1$ that states the presence of the property. $H_0$ and $H_1$ must be mutually exclusive (no result could satisfy both conditions) and exhaustive (all possible results will satisfy one of the two conditions). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The purpose of the hypothesis testing is to conclude weather the null hypothesis can be rejected or not. Rejecting $H_0$ often means that we have discovered some new feature and this probably not due to chance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Make a decision about the significance $\\alpha$. Errors are unavoidable and $\\alpha$ is the accepted probability to make a type 1 error. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This error means the rejecting $H_0$ though it is true (\"Yay, we've got it\" by mistake). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Usual value for $\\alpha$ is $0.05$, however there are   studies with $\\alpha=0.01$ or even smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the range of the experiment outcomes such that when  the observations fall within we have to accept $H_0$ hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the computed range estimate the type 2 error probability   $\\beta$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This error means that we fail to reject $H_0$ even when it is false. (The discovery was right in front of us but we've missed it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usually taking very small $\\alpha$ results in increasing $\\beta$. The overall setup is correct if $\\beta$ is not much higher then $\\alpha$. For $\\alpha=0.05$ the appropriate is $\\beta\\approx 0.1$."
