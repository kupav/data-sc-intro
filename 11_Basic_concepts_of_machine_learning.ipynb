    "### Classical science vs machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "All science is about prediction of a future. \n",
    "\n",
    "First of all one collects data from a domain of interest: records planets locations vs time of year, or air temperature vs wind \n",
    "speed, or canon ball distance vs amount of gun powder and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then one tries to extract dependencies: does one value really depends on another? What can be a mathematical formula for this \n",
    "dependence? \n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is to check the revealed mathematical formulas on new observations. Do they rely work? After this step experimental laws appear: Newton's second law and Coulomb's law in physics, or Mendelian inheritance in genetics and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "When enough number of the laws are discovered a mathematical theory appears that integrates them and provides the tools for making predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of predictions done in this way are: marine navigation (one predicts ship location observing stars), safe bridge load (one can compute it knowing properties of materials), probability of genetic diseases (using genetics laws).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem in creation of science in this way is to find the most simple, fundamental governing laws that lay in \n",
    "the basis of all other laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics such fundamental law is for example Newton's laws of motions, in genetics this is a knowledge about DNA structure and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the law means the law: the things alway occur as it states. No exclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of the whole filed depends on the success in finding such basic laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this can be called classical approach in knowledge creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of the XX century when computes allowed to deal with large amount of data, scientists started trying to apply the classical ideas to a more complicated areas, like for example social relations or medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in such areas no fundamental law can be found. Only some probabilistic dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a lot of practical experience in a certain area, say medicine, you are an expert. \n",
    "\n",
    "May be you do not know the exact fundamental laws (because nobody knows) but you are sure that an event A most probably will be followed by an event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example a medical doctor observing certain symptoms can be sure that a patient has a certain disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we formalize this experience, how can we take the knowledge from an expert and put it to a computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer expert systems were created. Mostly they were lists of manually coded rules \"if then else\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The rule were created after questioning experts in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact this was just a try to apply classical methods to fields where they did not worked properly: \n",
    "recall that the classical science approach requires to move from raw observations to extracting laws. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the computer expert systems were stuck on the first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main problems of the computer systems purely based on expert rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No generalization. We can only answer the questions that the expert were asked. No laws derived so that previously unseen cases can not be properly proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No universality. Solves only specific problems and cannot solve any others. Expert opinion based computer systems could not recognize faces on photos. Because no one human expert can firmly formulate strict rules that allows him to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why machine learning concept has appeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is collection of mathematical methods and computer algorithms that automatically\n",
    "extract knowledge from data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The generalization and universality is the key requirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The extracted knowledge must be generic. \n",
    "\n",
    "It means that the machine learning method can not just remember answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "It must derive common dependencies in data and must be able correctly process new previously unseen cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what classical science does extracting fundamental laws from experimental data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classical science laws are discovered by humans. The generalizing of the data is performed automatically \n",
    "by a computer program in the course of learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since the classical laws are discovered by humans they have a form understandable for humans. These laws are represented \n",
    "as mathematical equations or text in natural language. Machine learning knowledge obtained after generalization of data \n",
    "is an of numbers. Typically this is huge array of number. In the most cases humans can not understand this knowledge. We can only \n",
    "use it without knowing why it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning methods are universal. They are applicable in every filed that can be described by a dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there some methods works better for face recognition while others are preferred for time series predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the key ideas are common and all domain of interest can be analyzed using machine methods."

    "\n",
    "The model with overfitting performs very well on the train data but fails on any new data.\n",

    "The opposite problem is underfitting.\n",

    "A model with underfitting performs bad even on training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting usually appears when the model is too complex\n",
    "for a given dataset, i.e., has too many parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting on the contrary means that the model is too simple. Number of \n",
    "its degrees of freedom (parameters) is not enough to store the extracted information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fighting underfitting and overfitting is the central problem of creation of an appropriate machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model is underfitted we need to add more capacity to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "It means that its structure must be changed to add more parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can and more structure parts to the model (e.g., more layers to a neural network), or we can collect \n",
    "more features from the domain of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple trick is to add new data columns as powers of the old ones: squares, cubes and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "And if the overfitting occurs we can either simplify the mode by decreasing number of its parameter, or we can try to \n",
    "find more data (often this is impossible) to enlarge the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more way to fight the overfitting is called regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization means limiting parameter variation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitted models often have very large by magnitude parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we apply the regularization we add a penalty to the parameter magnitude: the smaller the better.\n",
    "\n",

    "In the course of training we switch off at random some model parameters, i.e., exclude them from the training routine.\n",
