    "### Idea of k-nearest neighbors method\n",
    "\n",
    "k-nearest neighbors or kNN methods is the simplest supervised learning method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised means that we train a model using an annotated dataset: each for each record the desired output is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "kNN method can be used both for classification and for regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classification means that all data can be categorized into several classes. If there are two classes this is binary\n",
    "classification: spam or not spam. The goal of training is to built a model that predicts a class for a new previously unseen data.\n",
    "- Regression means that the data represent an unknown dependence like $y=f(x)$. Here $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. The goal is \n",
    "to build a model able to predict real value $y$ for a new, previously unseen real value $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common idea behind the nearest neighbors method is simple and intuitively obvious:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know somebody's preferences, e.g. preferred shopping areas or cinemas, look around at his/her closest neighbors. The preferences most probably will be the same."

    "### kNN classification\n",
    "\n",
    "When the dataset is analyzed we locate each record as a point in a multidimensional space. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training merely means that a model remembers the all train data with the corresponding labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a new data point arrives the distances are computed between it and the all the stored training data to reveal its $k$ nearest neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Value of $k$ is specified as a model parameter. It can be 1 or 3 or something like that. Usually this is not too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering more then one neighbors, they vote to assign a label. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that it is counted how many neighbors belong to each class. The new point is assigned a more frequent label.\n",
    "\n",
    "If for example $k=3$ and there are 2 classes. For a given data point the model have found neighbors with the following classes: (0, 0, 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the point will be labeled as belonging to the class 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume however that we consider $k=5$ and 3 classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible that among the neighbors two different classes will appear twice: The neighbors can be like this (0,0,1,1,2).\n",
    "\n",
    "What class to choose, 0 or 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "Such situations are called ties.\n",

    "Their resolution depend on the implementation of the kNN model. There are several options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pick the winning first class in a list of neighbors.\n",
    "- Pick one of the winners at random.\n",
    "- Weight the votes by distance and pick the weighted winner.\n",
