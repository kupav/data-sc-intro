    "company and the fruit. \n",
    "\n",

    "The idea of building embeddings can be extended. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Word2Vec` approach each word in the vocabulary had a vector representation. \n",

    "\n",
    "Each word is encapsulated a combination of character n-grams. \n",

    "Each of these n-grams has a vector representation. \n",

    "\n",
    "The trivial solution is to average all word vectors including in a sentence.\n",
